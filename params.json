  "body": "## Project Proposal\r\n### Summary\r\nWe will write an efficient, parallel shakashaka solver using JavaScript Web Workers, and compare it against a sequential implementation.\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n[Shakashaka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakashaka) is a logic puzzle, in which you fill a grid of squares with triangles to form rectangles. It is similar to nonograms in concept, and is known to be NP-complete. \r\n\r\n####Rules of Shakashaka　\r\n\r\n![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-D6Kxz3J51q8/TtpOtaO1KrI/AAAAAAAAATk/u35eNqONGlg/s1600/Shakashaka+Example.png)\r\n\r\nEach white square can be filled by at most one black triangle and each triangle can 4 possible orientations.\r\n\r\nJavaScript [Web Workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers) allow us to run multithreaded code in the browser.\r\n\r\n### Challenges\r\nWe are traversing a tree of possible grid configurations that spreads exponentially. We will need to figure out an efficient way to distribute the work among the workers (so that as many workers as possible are working at any given time) while not taking up too much memory. To be efficient with memory, we will need to think of an efficient way to duplicate data when we're going down multiple branches (for different configurations of moves). We will also need to determine what we parallelize across, and the bottleneck of the algorithm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
